## 📖 About the Project

The Tourist Guidance Museum is a living, evolving digital experience that brings Egypt’s rich heritage closer to everyone. It celebrates artifacts, stories, and the people who care for them — connecting communities with their cultural identity.

This platform supports the initiative **“It’s Your Own: Protect Your Identity”**, launched alongside the opening of the **Grand Egyptian Museum** (November 1st, 2025). Our goal is simple and powerful: help every visitor feel the pride of their history and the responsibility to preserve it.
